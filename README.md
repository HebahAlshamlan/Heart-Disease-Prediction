# Heart-Disease -Prediction
Logistic regression classifier 

Heart	disease	describes	a	range	of	conditions	that	affect	heart.	Diseases	under	the	heart	disease	umbrella	include	blood	vessel	diseases,	such	as	coronary	artery	disease,	heart	rhythm	problems	(arrhythmias)	and	heart	defects	(congenital	heart	defects),	among	others.	Heart	disease	is	one	of	the	biggest	cause	for	morbidity	and	mortality	among	the	population	of	the	world.	Prediction	of	cardiovascular	disease	is	regarded	as	one	of	the	most	important	subject	in	the	section	of	clinical	data	analysis.	

# Pipeline
1\ partioning (75% training 25% teting) <br />
2\ Normalization <br />
3\ calculate sigmoid<br />
4\ compute logistic recreation Cost<br />
5\ learn logistic recreation Theta :
to get the best theta parameters for	the	given	lambda	value<br />
6\ train logistic recreation Model:
applies	10-fold	cross	validation	to	choose	the	best	lambda	value<br />
7\  predict the Class.<br />

#  Test Performance
calculates accuracy,	recall,	precision,	and	f-score.
